    <h2>Algebra</h2>
    <p>
        Following the steps laid out in the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/">original article</a>, each subreddit is converted into a vector. The operations add and subtract each subreddit's vector. Then they get normalized and the similarity (dot product) is taken between them.
    </p>
    <h2>Maps</h2>
    <p>
        Maps are generated using two different methods, but both of them rely on the same core ideas. A more in-depth explanation is presented in this <a href="{% static 'Subreddit_LSA.pdf' %}">document</a>. But in essence, the approaches both try to find a combination of the outer subreddits that is similar to the inner subreddit. The "538" solution is the one used by Trevor in his original post. It finds the similarity between the inner vector and the outer vectors. The "NNLS" solution is a closer approximation to the optimization problem of creating the most similar vector to the inner vector, by just using a non-negative weighted sum of the outer vectors. It's called "NNLS" because it attempts to solve the problem using non-negative least squares. It is by no means optimal, but the "NNLS" solution will generally have a higher score than the "538" solution, and it will generally go to the outer edges/corners. To demonstrate this, look at the default example; even though r/Feminism has some similarity to the other subreddits, you can produce a much more accurate representation by just using r/jillstein and r/hillaryclinton.
